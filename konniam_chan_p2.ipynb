    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",

A word that appears many times in a certain document would get a high count in CountVectorizer. But this word (say \"you\") appears in many documents, the idf part of tfidf puts a lower weight on this word, as it is not as predictive of the document's class.  \n",

    "From the above 3 examples with the largest R ratios (i.e. model predictions were way off), we can see that religious posts from talk.religion.misc are mischaracterized as comp.graphics. In both cases, the posts talked about the Book of Mormon, but also mentioned \"ftp\", \"online\", and \"internet\". These terms combined likely have stronger weights than the term \"Mormon\". One idea would be to increase influence of proper nouns like \"Book of Mormon\", which could give more context than terms like \"ftp\" and \"internet\". This could be done by repeating them a few times in the preprocessor to increase their contribution to the topic.  "
